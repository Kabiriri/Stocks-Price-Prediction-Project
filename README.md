# Stock Price Movement Prediction

## Overview
This project develops a machine learning solution for predicting stock price movements. By leveraging historical market data and technical indicators, the project aims to help investors make informed trading decisions. Our approach includes extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and multiple predictive modeling techniques.

## Business Problem and Objectives
**Business Problem:**  
Investors face challenges in accurately predicting stock price movements due to market volatility and complex underlying patterns. This project seeks to build a robust model that classifies stock movements (upward or downward) and outperforms traditional technical analysis strategies.

**Objectives:**  
- Develop and compare various models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) for stock price classification.
- Evaluate model performance against baselines and traditional technical indicators.
- Determine optimal prediction time horizons.
- Quantify the financial impact of the model through backtesting.

> *Include a flowchart showing the key business questions and how each objective addresses those questions.*

## Dataset Description
- **Source:** Historical stock data (e.g., from Yahoo Finance).
- **Coverage:** 25 years of data for 20 diverse stocks across multiple sectors.
- **Features:** Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close, Volume, and technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI, Bollinger Bands).
- **Target:** A binary indicator representing upward (1) or downward (0) stock price movement.

> **Image Suggestion:**  
> *Display a sample snapshot of the dataset or a summary chart that illustrates the distribution of key features.*

---

## Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
Key steps include:
- **Data Cleaning:** Removing non-numeric columns (e.g., Date, Ticker) and handling missing values.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating technical indicators such as moving averages, RSI, and Bollinger Bands.
- **Feature Selection:** Using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to identify the most predictive features.
- **Train-Test Split:** Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets with stratified sampling.

> **Image Suggestion:**  
> *Insert a pipeline diagram that visualizes the data preprocessing steps, including cleaning, feature engineering, and selection.*

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA provides insights into data patterns and helps guide model development. Our analysis covered:
- **Univariate Analysis:**  
  - Distribution of closing prices, volume, and technical indicators.
- **Bivariate Analysis:**  
  - Relationships between volume and price, and between technical signals and subsequent price changes.
- **Multivariate Analysis:**  
  - Correlation heatmaps and pairplots to understand interactions among multiple features.

> **Image Suggestions:**  
> - A histogram or density plot of closing prices for a few representative stocks.  
> - Scatter plots showing relationships between trading volume and price changes.  
> - Correlation heatmaps highlighting the interdependencies among technical indicators.

## Modeling Approach
We experimented with multiple models:

1. **Logistic Regression (Baseline):**  
   - Achieved high accuracy (approximately 88â€“89%) with balanced performance across classes.
2. **Decision Tree Models:**  
   - The basic unpruned decision tree showed high accuracy (around 93%) but overfitted.
   - Pruned decision trees improved generalization but varied in performance.
3. **Random Forest:**  
   - Provided improved generalization over pruned decision trees but still lagged behind logistic regression in our experiments.

### Final Model Recommendation
Based on the comparisons, the **basic logistic regression model** currently offers the best balance of accuracy, interpretability, and generalization.

## Model Evaluation & Results
- **Logistic Regression:** ~88.49% accuracy, balanced metrics (precision, recall, f1-score ~0.88).
- **Unpruned Decision Tree:** High accuracy (~93%) but overfitting concerns.
- **Pruned Decision Tree (without class balancing):** ~86% accuracy.
- **Random Forest:** ~74.59% accuracy.
  
The logistic regression model consistently outperforms the others in generalization despite the simplicity of its linear approach.

## Future Work & Improvements
- **Advanced Modeling:** Explore ensemble methods (e.g., Gradient Boosting, XGBoost) and deep learning models (e.g., LSTM for sequential data).
- **Feature Engineering:** Incorporate additional features such as news sentiment, macroeconomic indicators, or alternative technical indicators.
- **Backtesting:** Evaluate the model's impact on trading decisions by simulating trades using historical data.
- **Optimization:** Fine-tune model hyperparameters further and address any residual class imbalance issues.
